# CIO Programming Test

The goal of this exercise is to understand your approach to solving a task. A perfect result is not required. What matters most is your methodology, clarity, and reproducibility.

## Task
Your task is to count the number of ricecorn in the image `figs/rice.png` and to colour each ricecorn with a unique colour. Then save the colourised result and document how to run your code.
![rice.png](figs/rice.png)


### Step 1: Accessing the repository
- You need a GitHub account.
- Start the exercise by visiting the repository link: [https://classroom.github.com/a/q4O_3JXp](https://classroom.github.com/a/q4O_3JXp)
- Clone or download the repository to your computer.

### Step 2: Solve the task

Write code that performs the following:
- Load the image `figs/rice.png`.
- Detect and count each ricecorn.
- Colour each detected ricecorn with a different colour.
- Save the output image as `figs/rice_coloured.png`.
- Add the final number of ricecorn to the `Readme.md` file.
- Add a short comment in the `Readme.md` stating whether the count is complete or if some ricecorn were missed.

**Note:** You may use any programming language or library that you prefer (Python preferred).


### Step 3: Documentation
Add a description in the `Readme.md` that explains how to run your code. Please include:
- All steps needed to set up and run your solution.
- Instructions to create and activate any Conda environment if required.
- Instructions for installing all dependencies.
- Clear steps to execute the script or program so that we can reproduce your result without issues.

Assume the reviewer is familiar with:
- Terminal and command line
- Conda, Miniconda, or Micromamba
- Creating and activating Conda environments


### Step 4: Push your code
- Push all your code, documentation, and results to your own GitHub repository.
- Send us the link to your repository when you are done.



**Remarks:** 
- Any programming language is allowed (Python preferred).
- Even if you do not manage to count all ricecorn, this is acceptable.
- The most important part is your approach, structure, and clarity.
- Make sure your instructions allow us to run your code without problems.
